    <br><p><b>Italian earthquake tragedy spurs further consideration</b></p>
    <p>It's been three years since the <a href="https://temblor.net/earthquake-insights/italy-earthquakes-after-todays-m6-6-whats-next-1678/">M 6.6 Norcia</a>, Italy, earthquake. That event was preceded two months earlier by the nearby M 6.2 Amatrice earthquake which claimed 300 lives. Now, data from these tragic events are revealing a new technique to determine whether a large earthquakes will be followed by an even larger earthquake -- in real time. </p>

    <Center><em>An animation from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) showing an earthquake sequence with foreshocks, a large mainshock, and aftershocks.</em></Center><br>
    
    <p>A <em>main</em>shock is identified by its size, as the largest event in an earthquake sequence, whereas a <em>fore</em>shock is determined by its relative timing before the mainshock. <em>After</em>shocks are events that come in the months, years, or even decades following the mainshock. The trouble has been that you can only identify if an earthquake is a foreshock afterwards. </p>
    
    <p>An example of this mainshock-cum-foreshock problem was demonstrated by the Ridgecrest sequence in California this summer. The M 6.4 July 4th event was assumed to be the mainshock, <a href="https://temblor.net/earthquake-insights/magnitude-7-1-earthquake-rips-northwest-from-the-m6-4-just-34-hours-later-9041/">until a M 7.1 ruptured only 34 hours later</a>. According to the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/megaqk_facts_fantasy.php">USGS</a> "[a]bout 5% to 10% of earthquakes in California are followed by a larger one within a week and then are considered a foreshock".</p>
    
    <br><p><b>Measuring stress changes after an earthquake</b></p>
    <p>Lead author Dr. Gulia has been studying the statistics of earthquakes to try to understand the evolution of hazards in time and space. In a study published in 2018 she showed that most earthquakes with magnitude greater than 6 create an increase in stress afterward, as measured by something called the b value.</p>
    
    <p>This value is the ratio of small to large earthquakes, and it's been shown to be inversely related to the differential stress on the fault [Schorlemmer et al., 2005]. This is important because the distribution of different sizes of shocks is relatively easy to measure, but becomes a powerful tool to understand the state of stress. Lots of small earthquakes, and therefore a higher b value, means the stress is lower. Conversely, lots of larger earthquakes, and hence lower b value, means the stress is higher.</p>
    
    <p>It stands to reason that a large earthquake would generally decrease the stress on the fault, causing an increased b-value. Shockingly, however, Dr. Gulia observed a clear break in the pattern for some large earthquakes:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1606-4">[S]equences diverting from the generally observed increased b value after a mainshock are those of high concern, for which a subsequent larger event is likely to occur.
    </blockquote> 
    <p>Gulia and her coauthor found that the b values were observed to decrease for the 2016 M 6.2 Amatrice event, which subsequently became a foreshock of the 2016 M 6.6 Norcia earthquake, and the M 6.5 foreshock of the 2018 M 7.3 Kumamoto event. They interpret the differential stress increase following the foreshocks as creating the necessary conditions for the mainshocks. In other words: a b value decrease after a large earthquake means a larger earthquake is still on it's way.</p>
        
    <br><p><b>Implications for short term earthquake hazard</b></p>
    
    <p>Using this principle, the authors devised a guideline for issuing alerts about potential large earthquakes. They define a 10% threshold for b value changes, relative to the pre-earthquake value, using a traffic light system. Any sequence that exceeds this threshold (10% increase in b) creates a 'green' light. This means that aftershocks are not expected to be larger than the mainshock. Changes in b value that are within 10% of 0 are a 'yellow' light, indicating that the results are ambiguous. A greater than 10% decrease in b, however, causes a 'red' light. This, Gulia and Weimer suggest, could be used by emergency managers to issue evacuations.</p>
    
    <br><center><a href="https://temblor.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bvaltrafficlight.png"><img src="https://temblor.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bvaltrafficlight.png" alt="" width="550"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10066" /></a></center>
    <center><em>Figure annotated from Gulia & Weimer [2019] showing the b value changes through time. After the earthquake, a 10% increase in b value creates a 'green' light. Alternately, a change of less than 10% would result in a 'yellow' light, and a 10% decrease in b heralds a potential oncoming large earthquake ('red' light).</em></center><br>
    
    <p><b>Is this finding new?</b></p>
    
    <p>Since the 1970's seismologists have known that b value decreases prior to a large earthquake. Helmestter et al., [2003] found that by summing the pre-mainshock seismicity for many events one can clearly see an inverse of the aftershock sequence, with decreased b-value, ramping up to a burst of seismicity for the mainshock. As explained by <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/morgan-t-page?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products">Dr. Morgan Page</a>,  </p><blockquote>It’s a selection effect arising from the fact that a larger earthquake is more likely to trigger a mainshock than a smaller earthquake.  This means a foreshock is more likely to be large than a randomly selected earthquake!</blockquote> 
    
    <p>However the application of this finding for identifying large foreshocks in real time, according to Dr. Page, is intriguing. </p>
        
    <p><b>Refining the technique</b></p>
    
    <p>As <a href="https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~seisweb/emily_brodsky/">Dr. Emily Brodsky</a> described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02972-z">her response</a> to the study, there are subjective choices that go into b value calculations. For example, Gulia and Weimer excluded aftershocks within the first 3 days after the Norcia earthquake but only exclude the first hour of aftershocks after the M 6.5 event in the Kumamoto sequence. Brodsky points out that if the authors had employed an identical procedure, excluding the first 3 days of aftershocks after the M 6.5 Kumamoto event, they would have gotten a 'yellow' light rather than 'red'. Are the decreased b values a fleeting signal that has to be caught immediately after some events? </p>
    
    <p>On a similar note, it remains to be shown that this work can be implemented broadly. The areas chosen for testing --- Alaska, Italy, California, and Japan --- are generally very well-instrumented regions. In addition to high quality, nearby data, the earthquakes selected from those catalogues are highly homogeneous: mostly shallow, crustal, onshore faults. This technique has yet to be replicated in regions with offshore faults and poor station coverage,  where aftershocks cannot be rapidly detected and well-located. A target region for this method would also need to have enough background (pre-mainshock) data for computation of a background b value for reference. Establishing fixed criteria for assessing b values after all major earthquakes is the next crucial step. "As long as the discriminant works," says Dr. Page, "then it doesn't matter the method".</p>

In this model, earthquakes trigger other earthquakes which may be larger. </em></center><br>
    
    <p><b>Can emergency managers use this information well?</b></p>
    
    <p>The authors suggest that identification of a foreshock, indicating an even larger event is coming, can help emergency managers with planned evacuations. This can be very important for life safety in the approximately 5% of M>6 earthquakes that are followed by a larger event, and in places where buildings are prone to collapse. However, this is a relatively limited usefulness, and we know that the impacts of earthquakes go far beyond the injuries. Displacement can lead to secondary health challenges in evacuation centers [Loayza-Alarico et al., 2013], business disruption, and psychological damage which may be very long lasting [Bland et al., 2005]. In the case of the Amatrice-Norcia sequence, evacuations lasted for months. </p>
    
    <p>Additionally, the messaging of this type of alerting requires careful consideration. A stoplight system indicates that things are good, intermediate, or bad. While this simplified messaging can be beneficial for communicating to the public, those tasked with making complex decisions rely on specific probabilistic data as well as supporting information about what to do with those data [Becker et al., 2019]. This is particularly true during prolonged disasters, such as a large foreshock leading up to an even larger mainshock. <a href="https://twitter.com/disastrouscomms?lang=en">Dr. Sara McBride</a>, USGS social science research coordinator for ShakeAlert, emphasizes that "cultural and social complexities can impact how our forecasts are perceived". This is why USGS only issues aftershock forecasts within the US, leaving risk communication to local authorities in other countries. A generalized approach for issuing evacuations, then, needs to be tied to local knowledge and personalized recommendations for psychosocial support, among other things. </p>
    
    <p><b>Focusing on short term forecasting doesn't stop disasters</b></p>
    
    <p>This study uses the term 'resilience', which refers to the ability of the community to bounce back after an event. Being resilient to earthquakes comes, in large part, from having buildings which are still usable after an event [ex: Wang & Rogers, 2016]. For example, the 2018 Anchorage earthquake in Alaska was a M 7.0 with an epicenter only 12 km north of a city of 300,000 people. Although shaking at the surface was lessened by the depth of the event, <a href="https://www.air-worldwide.com/Blog/Why-Did-an-M7-0-Earthquake-Close-to-Anchorage-Cause-Little-Damage-/">the city was mostly able to resume operations within hours or days due to strict building codes</a> which followed the 1964 M 9.4 Great Alaska Earthquake.</p>
    
    <br><center><a href="https://temblor.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anchoragesmall.jpg"><img src="https://temblor.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anchoragesmall.jpg" alt="" width="500" class="size-full wp-image-10107" /></a></center>
    <center><em>The Anchorage skyline, from <a href="https://www.iccsafe.org/building-safety-journal/bsj-dives/alaska-hails-building-codes-after-quake/">Building Safety Journal</a>, remained essentially unchanged after the 2018 earthquake. This was attributed to stringent building codes in the city.</em></center><br>
    
    <p>After all was said and done in Italy in 2016, the town of Amatrice was left in ruins and the town of Norcia was operating --- but it wasn't due to the evacuations or short-term forecasting. It was because the town of Norcia had experienced recent shaking, imbuing it with a social memory of earthquakes, and it had developed and enforced a higher building code for both new and existing buildings [Mazzoni et al., 2018]. As passionately expressed by Wang & Rogers, [2016]:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/segweb/srl/article/88/1/171/314287">Precursory processes of earthquakes are valid targets of scientific research, but for operational purposes, it is the responsibility of the scientific community to help society focus on effective long‐term mitigation strategy.</blockquote>
